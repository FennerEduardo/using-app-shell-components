## How to use Ionic 5 Full Starter App? - App Shell edition

This repo is an Ionic tabs starter with the Image and Text shell components from [Ionic 5 Full Starter App](https://ionicthemes.com/product/ionic5-full-starter-app).

This example app is the companion of [this video](https://youtu.be/kJeGy_faTCk) where we explain how to use the shell components from the template into your own Ionic project.

If you have any question or problem using the Shell please open an Issue. 

### What's the App Shell?

The App shell is the minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript required to power the user interface It improves the user experience by quickly launching a static rendered page (also known as a skeleton page) while the browser downloads the full client version and switches to it automatically after the content is available.

**The main goal of the app shell is to improve our appâ€™s perceived performance and user experience.**

[We wrote a super detailed post about this explaining all the benefits of using it](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/improved-ux-for-ionic-apps-with-skeleton-loading-screens).
